Imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) is the standard treatment for \\nnightmares, but its effectiveness in individuals with MDE remain understudied. This study evaluated whether IRT \\nis associated with greater improvement in nightmare symptoms compared to sleep education therapy (SET) in \\npatients with MDE. Methods: In this non-randomized controlled study, 53 adults diagnosed with both MDE and \\nNightmare Disorder (DSM-5-TR criteria) received either four weekly group-based IRT sessions (n = 28) or a \\nsingle SET session during the baseline interview, followed by a four-week waitlist before IRT (n = 25). Outcomes \\nincluded the Nightmare Severity Index (NSI), depressive symptoms (QIDS-SR16 and HAD-D), anxiety symptoms \\n(HAD-A and GAD-7) and suicidal ideation (item 12 of the QIDS-SR16). Treatment effects were assessed through \\nchange scores and pre- and post-intervention comparisons. Results: IRT was significantly associated with greater \\nreductions in nightmare severity (p < 0.001) with improvements observed across NSI subscales: frequency (p =\\n0.010), emotional (p = 0.003), diurnal (p = 0.017), and nocturnal impacts (p = 0.002). Associations were also \\nfound between IRT and reductions in depressive (ΔHAD-D p < 0.001, ΔQIDS-SR16 p = 0.028), anxiety (ΔHAD-A \\nand ΔGAD-7 p < 0.001) and suicidal symptoms (p = 0.002). Treatment-resistant depression predicted greater \\nimprovements in the emotional impact of nightmares (p = 0.007), while nightmare frequency was associated \\nwith reduced benefit (p = 0.008). Conclusion: IRT is associated with meaningful reductions in nightmare \\nseverity, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation in individuals with MDE. These findings support \\nthe integration of IRT in treatment plans for this high-risk population.\\nIntroduction\\nChronic nightmares, also known as Nightmare Disorder, are severe \\ncondition defined by the third edition of the International Classification \\nof Sleep Disorders (Sateia, 2014) and the Diagnostic and Statistical \\nManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (Diagnostic & \\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, s. d., 2023) as repeated and \\nlengthy dreams, extremely dysphoric, with clear memory, typically \\ninvolving life-threatening threats to safety or physical integrity (Sateia, \\n2014). These nightmares lead to significant distress upon awakening, \\nalthough the individual quickly regains alertness. The experiencing of \\nthese dreams, or the disruption of sleep produced by the ensuing \\nawakening, causes significant distress in daily life or impairment in the \\nperson’s functioning. Nightmare Disorder is overrepresented in psychi\\xad\\natric disorders. It is estimated to affect 2 to 8 % of the general popula\\xad\\ntion, compared to over a third among young individuals entering \\npsychiatric care (Akkaoui et al., 2022). In patients with Major Depres\\xad\\nsive Episode (MDE), the prevalence increases to 16.7 % and rise to up to \\n90 % when associated with melancholic features or suicidal behaviours \\n(Akkaoui et al., 2020). In these patients, nightmare themes often revolve \\n* Corresponding author at: Dr Julia MARUANI and Pr Pierre A.

Moreover, nightmares are associated with poor sleep \\nquality, early morning awakenings, and increased fatigue and depres\\xad\\nsive mood (Sj¨ostr¨om et al., 2009). The emotional impact of nightmares \\nseems to be more decisive than their frequency. Indeed, it is the negative \\nemotional charge of dreams that correlates with the severity of \\ndepression rather than the simple number of episodes. In addition, \\nnightmares often cause night time awakenings and insomnia, further \\nexacerbating the symptoms of despair and fatigue characteristic of \\ndepression (Akkaoui et al., 2022). Importantly, sleep complaints have \\nbeen found to predict suicidal behaviours independently of any under\\xad\\nlying psychopathology (Geoffroy et al., 2021). Among these sleep dis\\xad\\nturbances, nightmares seem to be one of the most predictive factors for \\nthese behaviours during depression (Geoffroy et al., 2022). It has been \\nobserved that over 80 % of individuals experiencing a suicidal crisis \\n(including suicide attempts or suicidal ideation with immediate intent) \\nalter their dream content in the months preceding this crisis (Geoffroy \\net al., 2022). A progression of dream content alteration seems to be \\nobserved, with bad dreams (dysphoric dreams) appearing approxi\\xad\\nmately 4 months before the crisis, nightmares (bad dreams that awaken \\nthe sleeper) occurring 3 months before, and suicidal scenarios in dreams \\nemerging around 1.5 months before the onset of the crisis (Geoffroy \\net al., 2022). Nightmares may also predict suicide recurrence. A pro\\xad\\nspective study involving 165 patients hospitalized for a suicide attempt \\nfound that those reporting frequent nightmares were three times more \\nlikely to attempt suicide again within two years (Geoffroy et al., 2022). \\nThis risk increased further if the nightmares persisted two months into \\nfollow-up (Sj¨ostr¨om et al., 2009). In patients with persistent depression \\nand frequent nightmares, recurrence rates reached 87 %. While the exact \\nmechanisms behind these associations remain unclear, several hypoth\\xad\\neses have been proposed. Nightmares may increase emotional distress, \\nworsen sleep disturbances, and amplify negative thinking and suicidal \\nruminations (Akkaoui et al., 2022; Geoffroy et al., 2022). They can be \\nunderstood as nocturnal manifestations of daytime psychological \\ndistress, particularly among individuals with mood disorders (Akkaoui \\net al., 2022; Schredl, 2016). These findings underlie the urgent need to \\ntreat patients with a major depressive episode and co-occurring night\\xad\\nmare disorder to prevent the progression of depressive symptoms into a \\npossible suicidal crisis, particularly addressing the nightmare disorder. \\nImagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) stands as the first-line treatment for \\nNightmare Disorder in international therapeutic recommendations \\n(Aurora et al., 2010; Krakow & Zadra, 2010; Krakow et al., 1995; \\nMorgenthaler et al., 2018; Romier et al., 2024). Built upon the principle \\nof Continuity Theory (Domhoff, 2001), IRT posits a seamless connection \\nbetween waking life and dream states, allowing the brain to integrate \\ndaytime experiences into nocturnal narratives. Moreover, it perceives \\nnightmares as modifiable behaviours (Krakow et al., 1995), enabling \\ncognitive and behavioural restructuring through the exploration of \\nnightmare scenarios with positive mental imagery (Romier et al., 2024). \\nIRT is widely recognized for its effectiveness in treating idiopathic \\nchronic nightmares or those associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Dis\\xad\\norder (PTSD) with no reported adverse effects. Studies have demon\\xad\\nstrated a reduction in nightmare frequency and associated distress for up \\nto 3 months with maintained efficacy for as long as 30 months (Augedal \\net al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2013; Krakow et al., 1993). Additionally, IRT \\nhas shown efficacy in a diverse psychiatric population (van Schagen \\net al., 2015). Interestingly, regarding major depressive episode, a first \\nopen-label and non-controlled study, demonstrated the effectiveness of \\nIRT in reducing nightmare frequency, decreasing anxiety symptoms, \\ndepressive symptoms, next-day distress, and nocturnal awakenings in \\npatients experiencing depression with nightmares (Thünker & Pie\\xad\\ntrowsky, 2012). Additionally, a second open-label and non-controlled \\nstudy illustrated the effectiveness of IRT in reducing suicidal ideation, \\nshowing a significant effect size in Major Depressive Episode with \\nnightmares (Ellis et al., 2019). However, there is a lack of evidence with \\ncontrol study on the efficacy of IRT in patients with MDE and Nightmare \\nDisorder. Furthermore, no study has been undertaken to assess the ef\\xad\\nficacy oof IRT on nightmares in depression using the Nightmare Severity \\nIndex (NSI). The NSI is especially interesting since this is a global \\nmultidimensional scale that encompasses all primary dimensions of \\nnightmare disorder as defined by the DSM-5-TR and ICSD-3, including \\nthe frequency, emotional impact, diurnal impact, and nocturnal impact \\nof nightmares (Geoffroy et al., 2024). In this study, conducted as part of \\nroutine clinical care and involving patients with major depressive epi\\xad\\nsodes (MDE), the aim was to compare an IRT treatment group with a \\ncontrol group that received Sleep Education Therapy (SET) during the \\nbaseline interview while awaiting IRT treatment for nightmare disorder. \\nThe outcomes included the severity of nightmare disorder, assessed \\nusing the Nightmare Severity Index (NSI), as well as depressive symp\\xad\\ntoms and suicidality in patients with MDE.\\nMethods\\nThe primary objective of this study was to explore whether IRT was \\nassociated with improvements in nightmares severity among patients \\nwith a major depressive episode, performed into routine care in the \\nDepartment of Psychiatry, AP-HP, and at the Chronos Center (Psychia\\xad\\ntry, Chronobiology, and Sleep) of the Paris Psychiatry Neuroscience \\nUniversity Hospital Group. The second aim of this study was to evaluate \\nwhether IRT was also associated with reductions in depressive symp\\xad\\ntoms and suicidal ideation and to identify potential predictive factors of \\ntreatment response. Patients aged between 18 and 70 years were diag\\xad\\nnosed with Nightmare Disorder and MDE by a psychiatrist and sleep \\nphysician according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5-TR \\ncriteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Patients who did \\nnot exhibit clinical symptoms of depression according to the DSM-5-TR \\ndiagnostic criteria were not considered. Patients could have pharma\\xad\\ncological treatment, which was not modified during the study period. \\nRoutine treatment consisted of 4 (120-min) sessions of group IRT \\ndelivered weekly in a structured sequence according to the standardized \\nprotocol developed by the team (Stern et al., 2022). IRT consists of 4 \\nsessions: I) therapeutic education and pathophysiology of nightmares, \\nII) practice of mental imagery, III) application of mental imagery tech\\xad\\nniques to nightmares with transcription of the scenario and participant \\ntraining in IRT at home, and IV) relapse prevention session and assess\\xad\\nment. The core of IRT involves reworking the nightmare scenario using \\nmental imagery and practicing exercises several times a day between \\nsessions. The control group was a waiting list made of patients waiting \\nfor 4 weeks to start the IRT treatment and that received sleep education \\ntherapy at baseline interview (SET). SET targets day-to-day behavioural \\nand environmental factors that contribute to poor sleep and was per\\xad\\nformed for the control group during a single session (Morin et al., 2006). \\nThe four IRT sessions and the SET session were delivered by the same \\ntrained psychologist specialized in IRT, along with a trained medical \\ndoctor. In the IRT group, participants were asked to engage starting from \\nsession 2, in daily mental imagery exercises individually at home. In \\naddition, they were asked to complete a daily dream log, in which they \\nrecorded the occurrence and frequency of nightmares, the associated \\nemotional valence and intensity, as well as any adverse reactions. We \\ncompared two groups: the intervention group and the waiting list who \\nbenefited from SET. The evolution of the characteristics of the control \\ngroup was evaluated using sleep, psychiatric and addictive question\\xad\\nnaires at baseline and pre-IRT, (immediately prior to entering the IRT \\nprogram), while the evolution of the characteristics of the IRT group was \\nassessed using pre-IRT (i.e., before the first IRT session) and post-IRT \\nmeasurements, a few weeks after the end of the IRT group. The pri\\xad\\nmary outcome was the change in nightmare symptom severity from \\nbaseline to post-treatment, assessed using the Nightmare Severity Index \\n(NSI) (Geoffroy et al., 2024) in order to evaluate the association between \\nIRT and improvements in nightmare-related symptoms. Secondary \\ncriteria included improvement in each sub score of the NSI from baseline \\nto post-treatment, as well as response to IRT, defined as a reduction of \\nJ.

Oleh karena itu, IRT dapat membantu mengurangi dampak emosional mimpi, yang kemudian dapat mengurangi risiko depresi dan ideasi bunuh diri.\n",
      "3. **Pengurangan Depresi**: IRT juga dapat membantu mengurangi gejala depresi, yang merupakan salah satu prediktor kuat ideasi bunuh diri (Thünker & Pietrowsky, 2012). Dengan mengurangi gejala depresi, IRT dapat membantu mengurangi risiko ideasi bunuh diri.\n",
      "4. **Pengintegrasian Pengalaman Harian ke dalam Mimpi**: IRT berdasarkan pada teori Kontinuitas (Domhoff, 2001), yang menyatakan bahwa ada hubungan yang tidak terputus antara pengalaman harian dan mimpi. Dengan demikian, IRT dapat membantu pasien mengintegrasikan pengalaman harian mereka ke dalam mimpi mereka, sehingga dapat membantu mengurangi kecemasan dan stres yang terkait dengan mimpi.\n",

Penelitian yang lebih panjang dan memiliki lebih banyak titik waktu dapat memberikan informasi yang lebih akurat tentang efek jangka panjang dari terapi IRT.\n",
      "2. **Jumlah sampel**: Jumlah sampel penelitian ini terbatas, yaitu hanya 53 orang. Penelitian yang memiliki jumlah sampel yang lebih besar dapat memberikan hasil yang lebih akurat dan dapat dieneralisir ke populasi yang lebih luas.\n",
      "3. **Penggunaan skala tunggal**: Penelitian ini menggunakan skala tunggal untuk mengukur gejala depresi, kecemasan, dan ide suicidal. Penggunaan skala tunggal dapat memiliki keterbatasan dalam mengukur gejala yang kompleks ini. Penelitian yang menggunakan skala yang lebih komprehensif, seperti Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), dapat memberikan informasi yang lebih akurat.\n",
      "4. **Kontrol grup**: Grup kontrol dalam penelitian ini hanya menerima satu sesi terapi, sedangkan grup IRT menerima empat sesi terapi. Hal ini dapat menyebabkan bias \"dosis\" dan perhatian. Penelitian yang memiliki kontrol grup yang lebih baik, seperti grup kontrol yang menerima dosis yang sama dengan grup IRT, dapat memberikan hasil yang lebih akurat.\n",
      "5. **Faktor non-spesifik**: Penelitian ini tidak dapat memisahkan efek non-spesifik dari terapi IRT, seperti dukungan kelompok, aliansi terapeutik, dan harapan partisipan. Penelitian yang memiliki kontrol grup yang lebih baik dan menggunakan analisis yang lebih kompleks dapat memberikan informasi yang lebih akurat tentang efek spesifik dari terapi IRT.\n",
